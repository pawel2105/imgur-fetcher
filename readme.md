### Imgur CLI tool

A simple tool that allows you to list and open up the top images from [imgur](http://www.imgur.com) by hitting the [imgur gallery API endpoint](http://imgur.com/gallery.json). Some of the code is documented.

### Running this

Just do `go run imgur-fetcher.go`

### Todo

* Add Pagination and display 25 results at a time
* Don't kill off the process after choosing a number
* Handle any non-integer inputs
* Handle out-of-range numbers

### Contributing

This is a small thing built at the [Cape Town Go meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Go-Cape-Town-User-Group/) to understand some of the concepts of Go. If you're keen to add anything from the todo list, or something like a few test introductions then feel free to submit a PR.
